I'm a professor of design at Northeastern University where Jalon, Brendan, and Chris are students joining us todayThey are a group of students who are currently enrolled in a class that teaches how to design technical solutions by leveraging artificial intelligence to improve people's livesAnd as part of their work, they are conducting interviews to better understand the challenges parents may be facing with the IEP process.And so our goal with these interviews is to identify what are specific problems in the generation of these IEPs so that the students, in this case the group that accompanies me today, can design and develop a solution that improves the experience of parents with IEPs  that also have to do with technologyAny question you don't feel comfortable answering, you can refuse to answer it, you just tell me no, I don't want to answer and there's no problem And we can always stop the interview anytime you want And we're going to talk for about 30 minutes I'm going to try to keep it brief 'cause I know it's too lateOkay, thank you so much Thank you, superSo just to be clear about it too, we're not going to keep the video of this call, we're just going to use the audio file and once we've transcribed our conversation that file is also going to be deleted.Super, so just to start, could you tell us a little bit about your child's age and grade level? Yes, I have two children, my child over the age of six is the one with the IEP and my baby is 15 months oldMy six-year-old's IEP is recent, that is, the IEP was given to him in kindergarten last year, because I have struggled a lot from the beginning because I know about his delay problem, so thank God they have helped me a lot and we already got the IEP from him, his diagnosis is ADHD,  Dyslexia and Learning DifferenceSo my son was born very premature, a pound and a half, and at six months he has had delays since the beginning of his life, his whole process has been very slow, so I already knew that he was going to need an IEP, but it was a pretty hard struggle at school last year to get it so soon.  thank God I already have it, so that's the diagnosis and maybe it's worth mentioning that I was also diagnosed with ADHD less than eight months ago in my adulthood, so as a result of my problems with focus, blurring and helping him, then he went as if digging a little deeper into my story and well, yes,  I also have almost the same problems as him Ok, ok, thank you so much for sharing this with us, thank you so muchSo, can you tell me more or less that your child has been in the current school district in the last year, since kindergarten started, or about how long has he been in the school district? Two years, in the school district two years, last year and right now that it's in first year.And are there any cultural or linguistic considerations that you think might be relevant to your child's education? Totally, totally I think it's a big barrier for us who speak Spanish, although it's important to have, to be multilingual, right? At school it is quite complicated to access the service and even more so for children who have some impediment to be able to learn as it is normally taught, right? Yes, rightBefore you had to fight for your child's IEP, did you have any prior experience with the process? Yes, an experience and I think it was very painful last year that I started from the beginning of the school year. Well, I talked, I waited three months to talk to the teacher about the slowness, right? With which he would take her to do the homework and everythingSo, from the first three months, the teacher realized how late he was. To tell her when we could start socio-educational evaluations My child gets frustrated very quicklyThey started to label him in the first few months that he didn't follow routines because at that time I didn't have a diagnosis yet.So, but last year he didn't have the diagnosis yet, so I wanted him to be evaluated, but the district didn't rush to do the evaluations because they said he was too young That his delay was normal I know it wasn't normalThen I had a very big barrier with the principal of the school who started calling my son too much for the school, right? Since he didn't follow rules, every day there was a situation with him. So I asked, well, what situations are happening with him so that I could know, help him, understandBut the school put me very, very, very, very my foot to tell me not to devalue my opinions about my son's delay And they put him as a complicated child Then all the more reason I started to fight to get the exams doneThank God, the teacher, the psychologist, the social worker were very supportive because they admired Pablo's delay And the earlier the PI process starts and the sooner he can have assistance to be able to learn, the less difficult it will be for him to move forward So yes, it was difficultLast year it was hard to fight for his IP, but yes, thank God I got it Well, that's goodAnd if you had to describe from 1 to 7, on a scale of 1 to 7, your current involvement in your child's education and the PI process, where 1 is little involvement and 7 is being very involved, where would you shape yourself or where would you put yourself? From 1 to 7? I'm going to be very honest and very sincere I'm learning I'm scared because for me culturally the English barrier is difficult I try to be as involved as I canI'm going to give myself a 5 because I still have a long way to go to continue learning, but I think I've come a long wayI have learned to have a lot of compassion for myself and understand that it is also difficult for me to express myself, to speak without fear, beyond the language, but because the way the director treated me was quite humiliatingSo, yes, I'm trying to lose my fear, but a 5 I think I'm improving because I'm having the help, right?, like Innovate Public School, who are supporting me and they're helping me with the IP Yes, yes, that's good And if you had to describe how your desired level of participation, I mean, how much would you like to participate from 1 to 7? What would you say it would be? I think a 10I'm losing my fear every time to support not only my son, but I see so much difficulty, really, for public schools, and even more so for children who have learning disabilities They're falling behind Now I'm going to ask you some questions that have to do specifically with your experience with the document.  with IPSo, how would you describe your overall experience with the IP process? Easy and difficult Easy to access, because thank God I've knocked on doors and they've opened the doors easily It hasn't been hard to find helpIt's hard for me to understand all the laws and for them to stay step by step I'm like very methodical of one step, one step, like everything so structured and that in all the information they give us about the IP sometimes I feel like I don't understand anything So, that's why I said easy and difficultEasy to access information, hard to be able to understand it a little bit For me, I too have the problem of focusAnd could you share with us any specific challenges you've encountered in trying to understand this IP process? A challenge? I don't know, maybe being able to face people, and in schools most of the time they think that because they are schools they know our children better than we know ourselvesI think that has been the biggest challenge for me, that my voice is heard, that although my son acts in some way at school, he acts in another way at home. I think that has been the biggest challenge for me in the issue of IP, to be listened to and to be taken into account.And what are the aspects of the process that you find most confusing or difficult to understand? Right now as you're asking me, I feel like a little blank, but maybe the most difficult thing I've been able to find maybe in the IP process is like Like maybe understand how far it's normal and how far it's not normal The paper maybe says the slowness with which I don't know,  that children have access to certainOne of the things that the PI papers say is that children have the right to have the necessary education, to be supported and provided with all the required service, evaluations, but it has been so difficult to obtain them.  yes, yes, yesAnd I'm going to go back to one thing that you mentioned at the beginning, which was the language barrier, of English and Spanish On a scale of 1 to 7, how comfortable do you feel reading in English? How comfortable? A 4Because I understand a little bit, but I think it's more fear that stops me, because I do understand a lot and I can express myself a little, but maybe when I start to flow a little bit I get very nervous and I stagnate and I forget But a 4 And does the same thing happen to you when you try to speak or I eat verbally,  rather unwritten? I think self-confidence is very importantIt happens to me that when people look very nice, like they are not judging me and they speak in a fluent way, it is easier for me and I feel more comfortable with someone who speaks very fastI think that when you start speaking English, the person who does speak 100% English instantly realizes that I don't speak English well and it bothers me a little that they start talking to me, talking, talking when they know that I'm having a hard time expressing myselfSo the little empathy that sometimes people have for those of us who are learning English and maybe they think, the typical thing they think, right? They're in this country and they don't know, but they don't know the challenges that we have behind us, if there's any diagnosis, if there's a problem or a situation, the work, then yes. Oh, sorry, it got cold, I didn't hear Oh, sorry, am I back yet? Can you hear me yet? Yes Ok, thanksDo you feel like you've been effectively included in your child's IEP decision-making process? Mostly yes, mostly yes Fighting and speaking and expressing my voice, yes, out of five people, three have helped me, two have notThe two that haven't helped me have been because, well, when you start to express yourself and say what you don't like and your disagreements, there's a problem for some people, right? And for others who see the problem and who may be aware, they don't So, three, two, three, two, and these people are more like in the school environment, that is, in the school environment? yes, yes, yes The heads, the headsThe heads are the ones that always put the most obstacles because, well, they are the ones that I consider in my point of view, they see children with difficulties as a problemThey don't see, they don't see them as one, as all schools want to have 10 out of 10 and the children who go slower, well, it is a reality that the score of the schools goes down, but it does not mean that they leave them aside, on the contrary, they should support them much more so that the school reaches the level of the school.  yes, of course, what resources or support would you like to have to facilitate your participation in the IEP process, to better understand the documents? I've been looking for classesFor example, there are people who tell me and inform me, but I would like maybe a place where I could take specific classes The book and the IEP process is very bigSo, I wish maybe there were more accessible classes, like English classes, right? Because it's really a world of information that if you don't look for the right people, you never find out about the benefits that these children can have.And how do you think the IEP process could be improved for Spanish-speaking families who speak Spanish? I think that maybe, I see it from my case, that everything is theory Maybe with examples, because it is difficult for me to understand them I mean, I am one of those who read a page and I have to reread it up to four or five times because it is difficult for me to understand the contextsMaybe if we could include some examples of situations or examples of how advocacy, it could be useful for people who have a hard time or don't have the ability to understand in a global way.Last section, are some questions that have to do precisely with the use of technology, given that the project we are developing is technological On a scale of 1 to 7, what is your level of comfort and experience in the use of computers or mobile devices such as a cell phone? I say that a 6 can use technologyWhat I struggle with a lot are like Word, Office, which are more specific, but searching the Internet, using the cell phone and all that, I think a 6 Perfect, thank youHave you ever used a mobile app or website to access important information from IEP-type documents? But as search engines? Yes, so you use it Yes, YouTube, search engines, yes, yes, yes, I searched for them Perfect, thank youAre you comfortable using mobile apps or surfing the internet to accomplish tasks? For example, searching for information, communicating with others, and so on Yes, yes, yes, yes, I think it's very useful PerfectDo you have experience downloading and installing mobile apps on your phone? Yes, apps yes, but then you can't use them anymore, but it's downloading, yes Ok, perfectHow do you feel about online security or privacy using that, apps, or websites? Not so secure, not so secure because unfortunately most apps say that if you accept cookies, I think they tell you, there I'm already accessing all my information, that they access all my information in the app, then not very secure Ok, perfect, thanksWould you be willing to learn how to use a mobile app or a website to access translation of IEP-related documents, for example? Yes, yes, yes, yes, of courseAnd how easy is it for you to access a digital version of your child's IEP document? How easy? A bit difficult because I've tried to download some documents as well as PDF, things like that, but I don't know what I'm doing wrong that they don't always download, or I don't know if it's the phone, but it's a bit complicated to download and see information Ok, perfect Just now you mentioned that you do that on your phone, right? On my phone, yesYes, yes, yes, because on the computer it's still more difficult to download, you need more things than just downloading some kind of software or something like that, I don't know how to do that Perfect, thank you And that's the last question OkayDo you have a preference for the type of platform you'd like to use? For example, a mobile app or a website to access IEP information I think that nowadays the phone is more accessible Everyone has a phone and carries it everywhere, so I think a phone app would be better Sure, superThank you very much Before we finish, we have a couple of minutes yet, is there anything else that you would like to share with us or that you feel is relevant? Also if you have any questions Well, no, no, thank you guysBelén told me about what they're trying to do and I think that, well, I don't want to get sensitive, but I want to be like you somehow, that I can try to help others and that I hear everyone's voice So that's why I'm here That's why I'm hereThank you very much for sharing that with us, Noelia We really appreciate it and we are going to do everything we can to develop a good projectThank you very much, thank you, thank you and best of luck Thank you very much And any questions Oh, sorry Don't worry Don't worryAny questions you have, whatever you need, please, through Belén you can contact us through Innovate Public Schools and we will be in touch as we develop the project just so that you can see the progress and what does work and what does not work, because we take into account your perspective and your opinions for real.  in a very serious way So, we'll be in touch Thank you very much, thank you Have a very happy afternoon Thank you Thank you very much See you later Bye bye Good night Okay, we have to jump to the other call Okay
