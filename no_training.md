"Speaker 1: Professor\nSpeaker 2: ParentSpeaker 1: Professor\nSpeaker 2: Parent of a child with an IEPGoing from one grade to the other, but it happened that when the school year started, the teacher came up to me and told me that the child had to move to another teacher because the teacher I had last year was not going to be available. So that for me was like something surprising because a teacher had already said that there was no child. So I told her, I have to talk to you, I have to ask questions, I need to know how you're going to work with the child because the child has different requirements, right? It's not like any another child because it really has that IP that makes the child have to receive support, right? Because otherwise the child really doesn't know anything. And she told me, well, we're going to assign an adult to him so he receives support, but as a mom I told her, but it doesn't work like that, the child needs the support, but also he needs to know how to work independently. Right? If he's assigned a support adult, that's not going to help him to work independently. The important thing is that he can learn and work independently so that he grows and learns and also so that as a mom I can give my child the support he needs, right? So with these teachers I don't have the same communication because I really don't understand 100% English, then I try to understand and I still don't understand so I have to ask questions and I say, sorry, but I don't understand this, so could you explain it to me again so that I can really understand what's going to happen, right? When I have a meeting with the teacher, I always try to ask, but it's as if the teacher didn't understand what I was asking her, then sometimes I feel frustrated because I say, I need that, it's my son's education, it's not that I need it in my education, I just need to know why I have my child in school and what he's going to achieve, right? And how can I help him, right? So with these teachers I don't have the same communication as with the ones I had before, so I feel frustrated because I sometimes feel that the teacher doesn't understand me or that she doesn't know what I want for my son's education. Thank you so much for sharing that. I really appreciate it. Is there anything else that you would like to add or share about your experience with IEP or working with the school? You know, I think given your experience and everything, your perspective and everything, I'm really interested in hearing anything else that you would like to add. Yeah, I think the most appropriate thing would be, well, it's something that I say of what and of what I have lived. Apart from regards to Brooklyn and teacher of the school, right? So what I would say is really what I have experienced in my life, right? In these moments, that really all that is the diagnosis and the process of evaluation and everything else is very confusing, especially when the child is diagnosed and the dialogue does not come out, because really it is something that if the teacher and the school understood everything much better, right? What is the situation of the child and the parent knowing. But what I would say is that as parents we have to be the voice for our children, we have to advocate for them, we have to support them, we have to ask questions when we don't understand anything, we have to seek help when we need it, but above all we have to be the voice, we have to be really with them and not let them really go alone when they start this type of educational process, because it is very difficult for them, right? To understand everything. So if we as parents are the voice, I believe that we can be and we are, because I think it's something that many parents want for our children. We can really achieve that everything goes well for our children in school, that they learn, that they can really develop in life and that they are really independent, right? But if we don't ask, if we don't know, if we don't search, then I really don't believe that everything is positive, right? Everything is going to be positive for our children. So I think that something that we as parents have to understand and we have to fulfill really is that part, of being the voice for our children and fighting for the rights of our children, because I truly believe that as parents we are the first educators and we are the ones who know our children the best and we know what our children need, right? So I remember that with both my children, my oldest son that we even started asking questions, right? But maybe only to the school. They didn't ask us questions at the early years, or my son started doing things like reading and writing, and going to a certain speed and my younger son was very delayed, right? Where he couldn't do things as the other children of the same age. So that's when I started asking questions, right? To see why my child is not going to the same speed, everything that my friend's brother couldn't do. But unfortunately what the school told me was that, just wait, just wait, right? But I really saw that the child was delayed. The older brother was a model for me because he went to bed and at the end of the school year, he finished without really much trouble. But with the second child, everything was different, he was delayed and I worried, right? Because I said, why can't you do something? And that's when I say, if we don't ask, if we don't see, if we don't look, nothing changes, I say. I say, that's why many times you have to see your children as a special and dependent children so that they can advance, so that they can grow, so that they can really be independent in life, because that's what we want for them, really, right? But if we don't ask, we never, I say, I really don't believe that we can achieve that our children really receive that support that they need in school, really. But I also have to say that really it's something that is very difficult, right? But that if we don't have the help of the school, it's the school team. I feel that we as a parent can really see it difficult to support our children, because really at the beginning we don't know what to do, we don't know how to start, right? So I think that the most convenient thing is that the school really supports us as a parent, gives us the tools, gives us more guidance, right? So that as a parent we can really help our children, right? So that they, I say, of course, the teachers are the ones who teach, but we at home at night or where we are, it's where we can also support our children so that they can do homework, so that they can advance, so that they can achieve that their, or can they learn better, right? That's what I say. So what I would say is that it is very difficult, as I said before, because really you don't understand. I am not a teacher, really apart from being a single mother, who don't learn those things, right? But at least as a parent I try to also advance, to really understand what the needs of our children are, right? Then I also took advantage of the need that I have with one of my children, I, when I go to school or when I have some trainings, I start to ask questions, I start to see, I start to learn and not only concentrate on my son or my child and his needs, I say, apart from my child and his needs, really start to see to search and to learn. Not only with the child I personalized, but with other parents of children who have the same diagnosis as my child, to start to learn from them how they are really supporting their childThey don't, I don't want to communicate with. And sometimes they come through the email, right? But I've tried my best to keep my personal information secure and not share it with anyone I don't trust. Perfect, thank you very much. And the last question, do you have any specific concerns or challenges related to technology that you would like to share? Well, sometimes I don't have Wi-Fi at home, so that's a problem for me because my kids need it for their schoolwork and sometimes it's difficult to find a reliable internet connection. And sometimes I worry about my kids spending too much time on their devices and not getting enough physical activity or social interaction. So those are some challenges that I face. Okay, perfect. Thank you so much, Carmen, for sharing all this information. It's been really helpful. We appreciate your time. Thank you. Thank you, you're welcome.Speaker 1: Professor\nSpeaker 2: Parent (Carmen)"
